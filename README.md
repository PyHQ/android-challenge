# Android Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to create single-view game.

## Game Instructions:
- The game presents multi-line code snippets to the user. The code sometimes contains an error.
- Two words in the code snippet are highlighted and the user must choose whether to **keep** or **swap** the words.
- If the code is already correct, there will be no need to swap them.
