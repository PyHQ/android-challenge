# Android Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to create single-view game.

## Game Instructions:
- The game presents multi-line code snippets to the user. The code sometimes contains an error.
- Two words in the code snippet are highlighted and the user must choose whether to **keep** or **swap** the words.
- If the code is already correct, there will be no need to swap them.

## Assets & Specification:

### Images
- The swap and check icons are SVGs in `/assets`

### Fonts
- "Swap" and "Keep" are Avenir-Next Demi-Bold size 18 (a different font is fine)
- The code is Menlo Regular size 28 (a different font is fine)

### Colors
- The background is #3F3F3F
- The codebox is #2E2E2E with corner radius 6
- The code text is white
- The pink highlight is #EA4EAC

### Animations
